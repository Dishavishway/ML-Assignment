# Implementation Machine Learning Model

This project is designed to handle classification tasks using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Part 1: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame using the `read_csv()` function.
- Missing values are identified and handled using techniques such as imputation with median for numerical features and mode for categorical features.
- New features are created from existing ones, including age groups and income categories.
- Categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding to prepare them for machine learning models.
- Custom functions are defined to calculate the mean and median age for each occupation.
- Another function categorizes income into 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High' based on predefined thresholds.
- Numerical features are scaled using Min-Max scaling to ensure all features have the same scale.

## Part 2: Implement and Tune a Machine Learning Model
- The Random Forest classifier is chosen for its robust performance in classification tasks.
- The model is implemented using scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier.
- Hyperparameters of the Random Forest model are tuned using GridSearchCV to find the best combination of parameters.
- Parameters such as the number of estimators, max depth, and minimum samples split are optimized.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
- Accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix are calculated to assess the model's effectiveness.
